# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Python project where the program randomly selects a number between a given range, and the user tries to guess it.  
After each guess, the program provides feedback — whether the guess is higher or lower than the actual number — until the user guesses correctly.

## 🧩 Features
- Random number generation using Python’s `randint()` function  
- Input validation with `try-except`  
- Infinite guessing loop until correct answer  
- Beginner-friendly logic with clean syntax and f-strings

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Python 3.x

## ▶️ How to Run
